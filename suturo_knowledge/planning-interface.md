# Planning API

## Overview

- [Data types](#data-types)
- [Utils](#utils)
- [Objects](#objects)

## Readers guide
Each section contains
1. a short description of a possible use case
2. the definition of the predicate
3. a codeblock with multiple examples, each one separated by 2 newlines

The examples are in the following format:
1. `?- ` followed by a query
2. The variable instantiations that Prolog found.

Meaning of the symbols in front of the parameter:
These symbols are the same as on <https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=modes>.
In short:
- `?` means this can be specified (an input) or be a variable (an output)
- `+` means this is only input (it has to be a concrete value)
- `-` means this is output (only putting a variable here makes sense for planning)

The definitions of what it is is also taken from there.
In short:
- `det` means it will always succeed once
- `semidet` means it will succeed once or fail
- `nondet` may succeed any number of times (this means `cut:lazy-cdr` might be needed to get all values)
- `multi` succeeds at least once

## Data types

### Object
An iri, for example `'http://www.ease-crc.org/ont/SOMA.owl#Table_MBOLQEWJ'` that denotes an individual object.

### PoseStamped
A list of Frame, Position and Rotation.
Position and Rotation are each a list of length 3 and 4.

`[Frame, [X, Y, Z], [RX, RY, RZ, RW]]`

## Utils

### Getting the object for a link name
This is useful for getting data about specific environment furniture, for example the tall table.

```prolog
has_urdf_name(?Object, ?URDFName) is nondet.
```

Example:
```prolog
?- has_urdf_name(Object, URDFName).
Object: http://knowrob.org/kb/IAI-kitchen.owl#iai_kitchen_fridge_door_handle,
URDFName: iai_fridge_door_handle ;

Object: http://knowrob.org/kb/IAI-kitchen.owl#iai_kitchen_oven_area_area,
URDFName: oven_area_area ;

Object: http://www.ease-crc.org/ont/SOMA.owl#Table_LXEIYGPZ,
URDFName: long_table:table:table_front_edge_center ;

Object: http://www.ease-crc.org/ont/SOMA.owl#Table_MBOLQEWJ,
URDFName: tall_table:table:table_front_edge_center.


% Notice that there are single quotes around the urdf because it contains non [a-z_] characters.
?- has_urdf_name(Object, 'tall_table:table:table_front_edge_center').
Object: http://www.ease-crc.org/ont/SOMA.owl#Table_MBOLQEWJ.


?- furniture_creation:has_urdf_name('http://www.ease-crc.org/ont/SOMA.owl#Table_MBOLQEWJ', URDFName).
URDFName: tall_table:table:table_front_edge_center.
```

### Getting the TF Frame

```prolog
has_tf_name(+Object, -TFName) is semidet.
```

Example:
```prolog
?- has_tf_name('tall_table:table:table_front_edge_center',TFName).
TFName: iai_kitchen/tall_table:table:table_front_edge_center.


?- has_tf_name('http://www.ease-crc.org/ont/SOMA.owl#Table_LTKIUPNG', TFName).
TFName: iai_kitchen/tall_table:table:table_front_edge_center.
```
## Objects
Any physical object that has a proper space region.

### Create an object

Create an object of a given Type at the given PoseStamped.

The `Type` can be the full IRI or the namespace:'Name' form.

The Options that can be processed are:
- `shape(ShapeTerm)` - optional, the shape the object has. If not specified, knowledge will have no shape information about this object.
```prolog
create_object(-Object, +Type, +PoseStamped) is det.
create_object(-Object, +Type, +PoseStamped, +Options) is det.
```

Example:
```prolog
?- create_object(Object, 'http://www.ease-crc.org/ont/SOMA.owl#CerealBox', ['iai_kitchen/long_table:table:table_front_edge_center', [0,1,1], [0,0,0.70711,0.70711]]).
Object: http://www.ease-crc.org/ont/SOMA.owl#CerealBox_LTKIUPNG.
?- create_object(Object, soma:'CerealBox', ['iai_kitchen/long_table:table:table_front_edge_center', [0,1,1], [0,0,0.70711,0.70711]], [shape(box(0.1,0.1,0.1))]).
Object: http://www.ease-crc.org/ont/SOMA.owl#CerealBox_BHVKCONR.
```

### Getting the pose of an object

```prolog
object_pose(+Object, -PoseStamped) is semidet.
```

Example:
```prolog
?- object_pose('http://www.ease-crc.org/ont/SOMA.owl#Table_LTKIUPNG', Pose)
Pose: ['iai_kitchen/tall_table:table:table_front_edge_center', [0,0,0], [0,0,0,1]]
```

### Object Pose and Shape Information
Because of [knowrob#368](https://github.com/knowrob/knowrob/issues/368) this is currently not done via `object_shape/5` but via `object_shape_workaround/5`.

```prolog
object_shape_workaround(?Obj, ?Frame, ?ShapeTerm, ?Pose, ?Material) is semidet.
```

Example:
```prolog
?- object_shape_workaround(soma:'CerealBox', Frame, ShapeTerm, Pose, Material).
Frame: CerealBox_BHVKCONR,
Material: {'term': ['material', {'term': ['rgba', '_', '_', '_', '_']}]},
Pose: ['CerealBox_BHVKCONR', '_', '_'],
ShapeTerm: {'term': ['box', 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]}.
```
Note that this is not the format you will see in lisp, there the `term` stuff is probably translated to a lispier structure, like `(box 0.1 0.1 0.1)`.
There might be a better predicate for this in the future, and the blanks in the pose might be a real position and rotation in the future. The `_` indicates that there is no value for this place.

### Getting important poses for the robot to interact with objects

Gets a position relative to the object based on the type of relation.

Valid `Type`s are 
 - `perceive`: (Optimal) Pose for the robot to position at to perceive the object
 - `interact`: (Optimal) Pose for the robot to position at to interact with the object (eg. grasp with the gripper)
 - `destination`: Returns the destination pose of an object. The destination pose is the pose where the object should be placed based on their predefined locations and current context. The destination might change over time.
 
Valid entries in the Option list are
- `direction(Dir)` with `Dir` being one of `['-x', '+x', '-y', '+y']`. This Option specifies the direction from which the robot should approach the object.
  For example, if `direction('-x')` is set, the position will have an x value that is smaller than the x value of the object.
  Currently this is only implemented for perceive.
  The default is `direction('-x')`.
 
 This list might be expanded later.

```prolog
object_rel_pose(+Object, +Type, -PoseStamped) is semidet.
object_rel_pose(+Object, +Type, +Options, -PoseStamped) is semidet.
```


Example:
```prolog
?- object_rel_pose('http://www.ease-crc.org/ont/SOMA.owl#Table_YTORLZXJ', perceive, [direction('-x')], Pose).
Pose: ['iai_kitchen/long_table:table:table_front_edge_center', [-0.7, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]].

?- object_rel_pose('http://www.ease-crc.org/ont/SOMA.owl#CerealBox_JDHUPSME', destination, Pose).
Pose: ['iai_kitchen/shelf:shelf:shelf_base_center', [0.0, -0.1, 0.51], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]].
```
